# eHash - blinded Diffie-Hellman key echange for "almost blocks"

# What is BDHKE?

Mint Bob publishes public key `K = kG`
Alice picks **secret** `x` and computes `Y = hash_to_curve(x)`
Alice sends to Bob: `B_ = Y + rG` with `r` being a random blinding factor (**blinding**)
Bob sends back to Alice blinded key: `C_ = kB_` (these two steps are the DH key exchange) (**signing**)
Alice can calculate the unblinded key as `C_ - rK = kY + krG - krG = kY = C` (**unblinding**)
Alice can take the pair `(x, C)` as a token and can send it to Carol.
Carol can send `(x, C)` to Bob who then checks that `k*hash_to_curve(x) == C` (**verification**), and if so treats it as a valid spend of a token, adding x to the list of spent secrets.

# What is an "almost block"?

Demonstration to a mining pool that you're hashing.

Mining share.
Weak block.
Proof of Work.

Used for hashrate accounting using [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)
p.s. hashrate measurement is a guess

# Why eHash?

Privacy
Smaller Economic Scale
Permissionless and accountless marketplaces
Because no one can stop you

## How eHash?

### Fork [Stratum v2 Reference Implementation](https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum)
### Fork [Cashu Dev Kit](https://github.com/cashubtc/cdk)
### Create [HashPool](https://github.com/vnprc/hashpool)

** Sprinkle in Redis to abstract some data availability not ready for demo ðŸ˜…
